## Machine Learning and Deep Learning - Models

This repository contains an extensive selection of `categorization models` based on `Machine Learning` and `Deep Learning`.

## Projects
* **Deep-learning:** includes various `classification models`.
  * **cat-and-dog-classfication** an algorithm/model to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.
  * **mnist-handwritten-digit-classification** an algorithm/model to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
  * **surface-crack-detection** an algorithm/model to correctly finding the cracks and determining the building health.
  * **mechanical-component-defect-classification** an algorithm/model to correctly identify the cracks and determining the component health.
  * **churn-modelling-explainibility** an algorithm/model to correctly explian how the model is able to produce particular outputs.

* **Machine-learning:** includes various `classification`, `regression` and `cv` models.  
  * **face-detection** an cv(computer vision) model to detect faces usign the openCV library.
  * **loan-prediction** an regression model to predict whether a user will have his/her loan approved.
  * **youtube-video-analysis** an model to predict the number of likes based on various paramater such as views, comments, etc.

## Getting Started

### Basic Requirments
- [x] Anaconda
- [x] Python (3.5 and later)
- [x] TensorFlow
- [x] Keras
- [x] Pandas
- [x] Matplotlib
- [ ] OpenCV
- [ ] LIME

After installing `anaconda`, create a virtual environment and install all the libraries metioned in the `basic requirments`

#### Open the anaconda terminal and switch to the virtual enviroment you created, type `jupyer notebook` in the command window to initialize and start working on jupyter notebooks.

Now you can just import these notebooks and start working on it.
